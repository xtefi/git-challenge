## Quick Oatmeal Pancakes

My husband used to not like pancakes and absolutely hate pancake syrup until I had him try the oatmeal pancake with mango or blueberry sauce. 
Now he regularly asks me to make some for breakfast. Serve warm with your favorite syrup or sauce.

##Ingredients

1. 1 cup milk
2. ⅔ cup quick-cooking oats
3. ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
4. 2 tablespoons brown sugar
5. 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
6. ½ teaspoon salt
7. ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
8. 2 eggs
9. 2 teaspoons butter, melted
10. ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
11. ¼ cup milk, or more as needed
12. 2 teaspoons butter, or as needed

##Instructions

Step 1

Place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in the oats.

Step 2

Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 2 teaspoons melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add 1/4 cup milk. Mix oat mixture and egg mixture with flour mixture; stir to combine.

Step 3

Heat 2 teaspoons butter on a griddle or skillet over medium heat; pour about 1/3 cup batter into the hot butter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on top layer, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook other side until evenly browned, about 5 more minutes.
